pipeline1: improved pipeline from HW2, adding more things like plotting correlation, dealing with outliers before plotting graphs, converting datatypes, adding more methods to fill null

pipeline2: generating features, building and evaluating classifiers

proceed-pipeline: combining the two pipelines to go through the whole thing

Writeup: data exploration and classifier performance analysis

clf_evaluations.csv: result from small_grid

Graphs from evaluation: precision_recall plots from small_grid
